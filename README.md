## The Game

As mentioned, the website just features a simple 3x3 Tic Tac Toe board game that can be played by 2 users, each player's turn is indicated along with their symbol ( X or O ).
Their is also a scoreboard in the bottom of the board that tracks the statistics of the round, those being: Player 1's Wins, Player 2's Wins and Tie Games.

Upon the finishing of a game the screen shows what is the result.

Clicking the Play Again button resets the board and adds the result into the current scoreboard.

The game can be played in one tab or 2 individual tabs (of the same URL) with both being in sync with the other's moves.
